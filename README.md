### Slides/notes:

### Hands-on:
1. Run `./bin/setup.sh` (read it before running!). Under the hood, this will:

	- Install python

	- Create a virtualenv folder in repo to store the dependencies in the next bullet

	- Install dependencies

2. Activate the virtual environment `source .venv/bin/activate`

3. Start the notebook: `jupyter notebook` (if you're not familiar with jupyter notebook, it's just an IDE. You can refer to the [cheatsheet](https://www.cheatography.com/weidadeyue/cheat-sheets/jupyter-notebook/))

4. Navigate to `mnist-starter.ipynb`
